Create Time Log
}
\description{
Creates a background table for logging and reading times. This can be useful for calculating the
  run time of code, or particularly, for helping to estimate the time remaining in an iterative process.
}
\usage{
time.log(action = "log", unit = "mins", comment = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{action}{
Character string stating the action to be performed. Accepts 3 values: "log", "return", and "clear".
  "log" appends the table with a new row containing the current system time, as well as calculations
  for iteration run time and total run time. "return" returns the log for viewing or storing as a
  dataframe. "clear" Clears the log.
}
  \item{unit}{
Base unit to use when measuring time. Accepts "secs", "mins", "hours", and "days".
}
  \item{comment}{
